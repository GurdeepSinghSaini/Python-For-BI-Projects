âœ… **What this prompt gives you:**
- Professional **README layout**
- Canva-ready image structure (`assets/â€¦`)
- Clean **tech stack table**, **use cases**, and **feature commands**
- Visual design guidance to make it portfolio-worthy

Would you like me to also create **short description lines** (1â€“2 sentences) to use as the GitHub repo tagline and social preview? (That helps make your repo pop in search ðŸš€)
